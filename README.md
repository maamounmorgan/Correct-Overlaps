# Case Study: Solving Data Overlap Problems in Spatial Data
# 1 .  Summary
This project is a practical case study demonstrating the use of open-source tools to address a common issue in geospatial data. I developed an automated programmatic workflow to detect and fix topological overlaps between polygons using advanced SQL queries on PostGIS and the GeoPandas library in Python. The result was a clean, accurate dataset ready for analysis, which significantly enhances overall data reliability and quality.
# 2. The Problem
The dataset used in this project faced a common issue: unintended overlaps between areas or polygons.

# ***Why is this a problem ?***
* **Inaccurate Analysis  :**
    Overlaps result in incorrect calculations when performing spatial analysis or calculating areas.

* **Data Conflict  :** 
  They can cause conflicts in information linked to each area (such as ownership or tax data).

* **Poor Data Quality  :** 
   Overlaps indicate errors in data collection or entry, which reduces the reliability of the system.



# 3 . Methodology and Solution
To address this issue, I developed a three-step workflow  :

## A . Detection Phase (QA - Quality Assurance)
***Tool***  <br />
I used an advanced **SQL** query on the **PostGIS** engine.

***Technique*** <br />
I used the **ST_Intersects** function to find any pair of polygons that overlap, while ignoring polygons that only touch at their boundaries using the **NOT ST_Touches** condition.

***Result*** <br />
I stored the overlapping areas in a **GeoDataFrame** using the GeoPandas library to accurately determine the number of existing overlaps.

## B . Visualization Phase (QC - Quality Control)
***Tool*** <br /> The **Matplotlib** library.

***Technique*** <br /> I created a visual representation of the problem. I drew the original polygons in gray as a background, then overlaid the identified overlapping areas in red. This visualization clearly showed the scale of the problem and the location of the overlaps on the map.

## C . Correction Phase (Data Management)
***Tool*** <br /> An **SQL** query on **PostGIS** .

***Technique*** <br /> The main solution was the **ST_Union** function, which merges all overlapping polygons, and then the ST_Dump function, which converts the unified geometric shape back into a set of corrected individual polygons.

***Result***<br /> I stored the corrected polygons in a new **GeoDataFrame** and visualized them to confirm the operation's success.

#  4 . The Results
***Problem Identification***<br /> A total of X overlapping areas were identified, confirming the presence of errors in the original data.

***Precise Solution*** <br /> A programmatic solution was applied to fix the overlaps instead of manual intervention, saving time and ensuring accuracy.

***Improved Data Quality***<br /> The final map showed that the polygons were successfully corrected and all boundaries were consistent, leading to enhanced data quality and reliability.
